# ipapi

Geolocation plugin for Flutter using IP-API.com's IP Geolocation API.

## Features

- Supports all platforms
- Supports both free & pro access to IP-API.com
- Free access does not require an API key.

## Usage

To use this plugin, add `ipapi` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-channels).

### Examples

Here are small examples that show you how to use the API.

```dart
// Obtain all available information for the current IP using the free API
final GeoData? geoData = await IpApi.getData("172.217.0.0");
print(geoData?.toJson());
/* Prints
{
    "query": "172.217.0.0",
    "status": "success",
    "continent": null, // optional field not included in request
    "continentCode": null, // optional field not included in request
    "country": "United States",
    "countryCode": "US",
    "region": "IL",
    "regionName": "Illinois",
    "city": "Chicago",
    "district": null, // optional field not included in request
    "zip": "60666",
    "lat": 41.8781,
    "lon": -87.6298,
    "timezone": "America/Chicago",
    "offset": null, // optional field not included in request
    "currency": null, // optional field not included in request
    "isp": "Google LLC",
    "org": "Google LLC",
    "as": "AS15169 Google LLC",
    "reverse": null, // optional field not included in request
    "asname": null, // optional field not included in request
    "mobile": null, // optional field not included in request
    "proxy": null, // optional field not included in request
    "hosting": null // optional field not included in request
}
*/

// Obtain all available information for an IP different to the current IP using the free API, using German language and querying selected fields only
final GeoData? geoData = await IpApi.getData({
    ip: '172.217.0.0',
    lang: 'de',
    fields: ['country'],
});
print(geoData?.country); // prints 'Vereinigte Staaten'
print(geoData?.city); // prints 'null' since field is not part of query

// Usage with API key automatically queries PRO API endpoint 'pro.ip-api.com'
final GeoData? geoData = await IpApi.getData({
    apiKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
});
```
